## Contents of the application

**i build the basic requirements that sent in the task mail**

 - *build S.P.A  with react & reudx* .
 - *build the ui responsive and used material ui framework*
 - *build a signin and signup pages and integrated it with firebase authentication method (signin and signup with email and password)*.
 - *and the todo list* .

## The Technical Choices

 1. **I choose to build this app with reactjs because the basic concept is based on it (Virtual DOM) and this will provide higher efficiency because it will not destroy and rebuild the full dom on every change in UI rendering , the rebuild will be only for the changed element in UI .**
 2. **I build this project structure based on "*Grouping by file type*" , there is another way "Grouping by features" but i found "the file type" good for this project because (it's not a big project) .**

## Upgrades For Project
***That's what i need to do but i don't need to late more :***

 - *add real secure routes & authentication* .
 - *integrate the redux store with firebase (realtime database)* .
 - *add more functionality for the todo list* .
